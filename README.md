# 100 Days of Swift

This is the collection of projects from the man, the myth, the legend [Paul Hudson](https://github.com/twostraws)

All of the projects are taken straight from [100 Days of Swift course](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100) and all of the necessary resources can be found [here](https://github.com/twostraws/HackingWithSwift)

The projects have been slightly reworked to feature newer APIs replacing either deprecated metods and properties 
or outdated approaches such as using Combine instead of KVO for value observation or replacing closure based delegate methods for Concurrency based ones (async/await) where possible
